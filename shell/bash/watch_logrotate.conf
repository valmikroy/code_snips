# Sometimes you have long running data collection command running which you would 
# like to rotate and compress to avoid increased disk utilization on some remote server
# Here is logrotate configuration which can be run with following command line 
#
#  logrotate -f logrotate_myfile.conf -s ./
#
#

"./test_out.log" {
        size 1k
        copytruncate
        rotate 4
        compress
}

# Above rotates over size of 1k
# compress
# retain last 4 copies 


# test file generated with simple while loop
# while true; do date '+%s'  >> test_out.log  ; sleep 1 ; done
